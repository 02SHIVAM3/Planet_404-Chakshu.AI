ü™ê ExoDetect ‚Äî AI/ML Pipeline for Exoplanet Identification

Automatically classify exoplanet candidates from NASA‚Äôs Kepler/K2/TESS missions as Confirmed, Candidate, or False Positive.
Includes preprocessing, a trained model, per-row CSV generation, and a responsive Streamlit web app for researchers.

üöÄ Overview

Thousands of exoplanet signals detected by space telescopes require vetting. Manual classification is slow.
ExoDetect uses a multi-class machine learning model to automatically identify true exoplanets, candidates, and false positives based on transit and stellar parameters from NASA‚Äôs open datasets.

Key features:

High-accuracy classification optimized for Confirmed planets.

Preprocessing pipeline handles missing values, scaling, and class imbalance.

Exports each row of the dataset as a single CSV file for per-row analysis.

Responsive Streamlit web app for uploading data, viewing predictions, and downloading results.

Model explainability with feature importance and SHAP visualizations.

üìÇ Dataset

Source: NASA cumulative exoplanet catalog (cumulative_2025.10.03_23.58.46.csv)

Rows: ~9,500 objects from Kepler, K2, and TESS

Features: Orbital period, transit duration, planetary radius, transit depth, SNR, stellar temperature/radius, etc.

Labels:

Confirmed ‚Äî validated exoplanet

Candidate ‚Äî likely exoplanet, still under review

False Positive ‚Äî signal misidentified as planet

The repository also contains a zipped folder of single-row CSVs, one per object, for researchers who need row-level files.

üß† Model

Type: Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost or LightGBM)

Objective: Multiclass classification (Confirmed / Candidate / False Positive)

Preprocessing:

Median imputation for missing values

Log transform for skewed features

Standard scaling

Imbalance handling: Class weights / sample weights

Evaluation metrics:

Confirmed precision ‚âà 0.81

Confirmed recall ‚âà 0.83

Macro F1, per-class F1, confusion matrix
